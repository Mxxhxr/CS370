on election night 2016
then president barack obama called
donald trump at about three o'clock in
the morning to congratulate him
even though mr trump had lost the
popular vote and took the electoral
college by less than one percent
in three states today president trump
declines to accept the verdict of the
voters despite
losing by greater margins to
president-elect joe biden
mr obama hasn't spoken of the election
standoff
until today we spoke to the 44th
president
on the release of his new book a
promised land
a memoir of his early years and first
term
the story will continue in a moment
what is your advice in this moment
for president trump well a president
is a public servant
they are temporary occupants of the
office
by design and
when your time is up
then it is your job to put the country
first
and think beyond your own ego and your
own
interests and your own disappointments
my advice to
president trump is if you want at this
late stage in the game to be remembered
as somebody who put
country first uh it's time for you to do
the same thing
in your view it is time for him to
concede
absolutely well i mean i think it was
time for him to concede
probably the day after the election
or at the latest two days after the
election
when you look at the numbers objectively
joe biden will have one
handily there is no scenario in which
any of those states would turn the other
way
and certainly not enough to reverse the
outcome of the election
more than the courtesy of a concession
the trump white house is declining to
free up the usual funds
and facilities for the incoming
administration
president-elect biden is not receiving
secret national security briefings
as mr trump did when he was
president-elect
what in your estimation would our
adversaries be thinking right now russia
china about the fact that the transition
is not moving forward
well i i look i i think our adversaries
have seen uh us weakened uh
not just as a consequence this election
but over the last
several years uh we have
these cleavages in the body politic
that they're convinced they can exploit
there's the old adage that partisan
politics
should uh stop at the water's edge right
that when it comes to
our foreign policy that it is the united
states of america
not the divided states of america we met
the former president at a symbol of
america's past divisions
the smithsonian's national portrait
gallery was a hospital
in the civil war clara barton and walt
whitman cared for patients in the
building
where the 16th president consoled his
wounded
we joined mr obama's peers in the
gallery of the presidents
to talk about his book i'm curious about
the title
i think a lot of people feel that we are
farther
from a promised land well i i titled it
the promised land
because even though we may not get there
in our lifetimes even if we experience
hardships and disappointments along the
way
that i at least still have faith we can
create a more perfect union not a
perfect union but a more perfect union
you write in the book our democracy
seems to be teetering on the brink of a
crisis
what do you mean we have gone through a
presidency
that disregarded a whole host of
basic institutional norms
expectations we have for a president
that have been observed by republicans
and democrats uh previously
uh and maybe most importantly uh and and
uh
most disconcertingly what we've seen is
what some people call truth decay
something that's been accelerated by
outgoing president trump the sense that
not only do we not have to tell the
truth
but the truth doesn't even matter what
are these false claims
of widespread election fraud doing to
our country right now
the president doesn't like to lose and
never admits loss i'm more troubled by
the fact that other republican officials
who clearly know better
are going along with this are humoring
him in this fashion it is one more step
in delegitimizing not just the incoming
biden administration but democracy
generally
and that's a dangerous path we would
never accept that out of
our own kids behaving that way if they
lost
right i i mean if if my daughters
in any kind of competition uh
pouted and and then accused the other
side of uh
cheating when they lost when there was
no evidence of it we'd scold them
you know i think that there has been
uh this sense over the last several
years
that literally anything goes
and is justified in order to get
power uh and
that's not unique to the united states
there are strong men and dictators
around the world who think
that i can do anything to stay in power
i can kill people i can throw them in
jail i can
run phony elections i can
suppress journalists um
but that's not who we're supposed to be
and
one of the signals i think that
joe biden needs to send to the world is
that no
those values that we preached and we
believed in and subscribed in we still
believe
president-elect biden won in this
election more votes than anyone in
history yeah
and yet the 2020 vote wasn't a
repudiation
of donald trump it was more like an
affirmation
he received 71 million votes eight
million more than he did in 2016.
what does that tell you about our
country today
well a it tells us that we're very
divided
and as i said it's not just the
politicians now the voters are divided
it has now become a contest where
issues facts policies per se don't
matter
as much as identity and
wanting to uh beat the other guy
you know that's taken priority i do
think the current and media environment
adds to that greatly this democracy
doesn't work if we don't have an
informed citizenry this
democracy doesn't work if we don't have
responsible elected officials at other
levels who are willing to call the
president when
he's not doing something right call him
on it it seems
though mr president that americans have
gone from disagreeing with one another
to hating one another the problem
that this man had uh you know and i
wonder he's
a he's a good example of uh of somebody
who
uh who i think understood deeply
uh the need to to be able to see
uh another person's point of view how do
we overcome
where we are today well there's no uh
american figure that i admire uh
any more than abraham lincoln but he did
end up
with a civil war on his hands i think
we'd like to avoid that
uh i i i i do think that uh
a new president can set a new tone
that's not going to solve all the
gridlock in washington
i think we're going to have to work
with the media and with the tech
companies
to find ways to inform
the public better about the issues and
to bolster
the the standards that
ensure we can separate truth from
fiction
i think that we have to work at a local
level
when you start getting to the local
level mayors
county commissioners etc they've
actually got to make real decisions it's
not abstractions it's like we need to
fix this road we need to
uh get this snow plowed we need to make
sure our kids
uh have a safe playground to to play in
and at that level i don't think people
have that kind of visceral hatred
and that's where we have to start in
terms of rebuilding the social trust we
need for democracy to work
mr obama is speaking after four years of
virtual silence on donald trump
he followed a traditional commandment
largely observed since
adam succeeded washington thou shall not
criticize your successor in a promised
land
he wonders if that was a mistake in your
book
you ask quote whether i was too
tempered in speaking the truth too
cautious
in word or deed many americans mr
president believe you were
too cautious too tempered yeah
and and i think that's a legitimate
and understandable uh
criticism at the end of the day i
consistently tried to treat my political
opposition
uh in the ways i'd want to be treated
to not overreact when
for example somebody yells you lie
in the middle of me giving a joint
congressional address
it's not true i understand why
there were times where my supporters
wanted me to be more pugilistic
to you know uh pop folks uh
in the head and and and duke it out a
little bit more
was it a mistake that you didn't every
president
brings a certain temperament to office
i think part of the reason i got elected
was
because i sent a message that
fundamentally i believe the american
people are good and decent
and that politics doesn't have to be
uh some cage match
in which uh everybody is is
going at each other's throats uh and
that we can agree
without being disagreeable there have
been worse presidential transitions than
2020 the southern states seceded while
lincoln was president-elect
still we couldn't help but notice
outside the national portrait gallery
businesses are still boarded up against
the fear
of political violence what should
president trump do on this next
inauguration day
look there is there are a set of
traditions that we have followed
in the peaceful transfer of power the
outgoing president congratulates the
incoming president
instructs the government and the
agencies to cooperate
with the new government coming in you
invite
the president-elect to the oval office
how are you
and then on inauguration day the
president
invites the president-elect to the white
house there's a small reception
and then you drive to the inauguration
site
and the outgoing president sits there is
part of the audience
as the new president is sworn in and at
that point
the outgoing president is a citizen like
everybody else and
owes the new president the chance to do
their best
on behalf of the american people whether
donald trump will do the same thing
we'll have to see so far that's not been
his approach
[Music]
but you know
hope spring's eternal there's a promised
land out there somewhere
two hours after mr obama said that
president trump tweeted from the white
house we will win
even though no state is reporting fraud
or errors that could change the outcome
we'll be back with barack obama on other
crises in our country
and one in his own home
during barack obama's first inauguration
in 2009
unknown to the public there was
intelligence that a terrorist attack was
planned
president obama had at the podium
instructions he would read to the crowd
should there be an evacuation of nearly
two million people
from the national mall this is one of
the insights in mr obama's new book
a promised land a memoir of his early
years
his historic election and his first term
we spoke to the 44th president about
battles
past and present
the story will continue in a moment
did you watch the video of george
floyd's strangulation
of course it was heartbreaking
um very rarely though did you see it so
viscerally
and over a stretch of time where the
humanity of the victim
is so apparent the pain and
the the vulnerability of someone
uh so clear and it was
i think a moment in which america
for a brief moment
came face to face with
a reality that african americans in this
country i think had understood for
quite some time and i was heartened
and and uh inspired
by the the galvanizing effect that it
had
on the country as a whole the fact that
it wasn't just black people
it wasn't just so quote unquote liberals
who were appalled by it reacted to it
and eventually marched
but it was everybody and it was
a small first step in
the kind of reckoning with our past and
our present
that so often uh
we avoid but mr president trayvon martin
yeah tamir rice briona taylor
right george floyd right why
is this injustice never
overcome well for a couple of reasons
one
is that we
have a criminal justice system in which
we ask oftentimes very young
oftentimes not very well trained
officers to go into communities
and just keep a lid on things
and you know we don't try to get at
some of the underlying causes for
chronic poverty
so if we're going to actually solve this
problem there are some specific things
we can do
to make sure that our contracts with
police officers
don't completely insulate them when they
do something wrong
putting money into budgets for
training these police officers more
effectively
teaching police officers not to escalate
but to de-escalate
but it's important for us not to let
ourselves off the hook
and think this is just a police problem
because
those shootings that devaluation
of life is
part and parcel with a legacy
of discrimination and jim crow and
segregation
that we're all responsible for and if
we're going to
actually put an end to racial bias in
the criminal justice system
then we're going to have to work on
doing something about
racial bias in corporate america and
bias in where people can buy homes and
and that is a larger project
in which all of the good news is all of
us can take some responsibility
we can all do better on this front than
we've been doing
scott how are you elbow bump i'm well mr
president
we joined the president this past
wednesday behind masks and then
kept our distance as the u.s counted 143
thousand known covet infections that day
a new record mr obama had also faced an
outbreak
in his first term a new flu h1n1
i was terrified of it and very quickly
mobilized a team
to figure out how are we going to take
the best possible approach
and from the start i had some very
clear criteria which was number one
we're going to follow the science
and the second thing was let's make sure
we're providing good information the
american people
but h1n1 was not as contagious nor as
lethal as cobit
it ultimately killed 12 000 americans
other battles in his book include the
financial crisis
passing the affordable care act the
decision to kill osama bin laden
and leaving eight years of work
in the hands of another you begin the
book by writing about the day that you
left washington
quote to someone diametrically opposed
to
everything we stood for that may be the
one thing that
donald trump and i agree on is that he
doesn't agree with me on anything
i don't see him as the cause for
our divisions and the problems with our
government i think he's an accelerant
but they preceded him and sadly
are going to likely outlast him you
write in the book
that republicans had a battle plan to
quote refuse to work with me
regardless of the circumstances the
issue or the consequences
for the country now the same might be
said of democrats
in a republican administration yeah i
wonder if today you think that democrats
and republicans are no longer
capable of compromise first of all
i don't think this is
just a plague on both their houses here
so the democrats opposed george bush on
a whole bunch of stuff
but ted kennedy worked with george bush
to pass
a prescription drug plan for seniors
nancy pelosi who
adamantly opposed the war in iraq
time and again voted even when her base
was angry about it
to make sure that our troops were funded
once the decision
to send in troops to iraq went in mr
obama blames gridlock on
something old and something new the
senate's filibuster tradition
which allows whatever party is in the
minority to block legislation
and non-traditional media
the media landscape has changed and as a
consequence voters
perceptions have changed so that i think
democratic and republican voters have
become much more partisan
i would often hear this from republicans
during my presidency some of these folks
had been colleagues of mine i served in
the senate
some of them were friends of mine and
they would confess to me i said
look mr president i know you're right
but if i vote with you on this i'm going
to get killed
i'll lose my seat because
what had happened is their voter base
had
soaked in so much information that was
demonizing me demonizing the affordable
care act
that it becomes very difficult even for
folks who want to cooperate to cooperate
and that's why uh i am somebody who does
not blame
the current partisanship solely on
donald trump or solely on social media
you already saw some of these trends
taking place
early in my presidency but i do think
they've kept on getting worse
the former president also writes about
his unlikely rise
including the obstacles at home
you're surprisingly honest in the book
about your wife's opposition to you
running for president
in 2008 you quote her as saying
the answer is no i do not want you
running for president
god barack when is it going to be enough
did i get the tone right yeah it was a
little sharper than that but it was
pretty good and then she walks out of
the room
why did that not stop you look it's a
legitimate question
keep in mind the context here we had
just two years earlier i'd run for the
u.s senate
in an unlikely race two years before
that i had run for congress
in a race you lost and a race i lost a
couple of years before that i'd run for
the state senate we've got
two young kids michelle's still working
and i ask myself in the book you know
how much of this is just megalomania
how much of this is vanity how much of
this is me trying to
prove something to myself and over time
she made a conclusion that i shouldn't
stand in the way
of this um she did she should not stand
in the way of your ambitions
to be president yeah and and and she did
so grudgingly
um and
the fact that i ended up winning didn't
necessarily alleviate her
her frustration because the toll it
takes on families
is real i think it's only
after you emerge from an all-consuming
job
that you realize that everything you
hold dear
is thanks to the one you love i think i
actually realized that even while i was
in the job
the fact that she put up with it
and forgave me
was uh
an act of of grace
that i am grateful for
and i'm not sure i deserved it the goal
here
scott today at age 59 mr obama is
working
on his presidential center so this is
going to be on the south side of chicago
in historic jackson park
and it's it's the place where
michelle and i met where i first started
in public life his team brought this
model to show us
mr obama's foundation has raised from
private donations
a little over half the estimated
500 million dollar cost it'll take about
four years
once they start it's going to be a place
where you know we have the standard
model oval office and michelle's dresses
which will be very popular no doubt
but also you know a whole host of
facilities that allow us to
provide classroom training to young
people who are interested in
public service and you know to beautify
a park that
can serve a whole bunch of young people
who've been
underserved in the past in his last
moments in the oval office
mr obama left a note in the president's
desk
for his successor it read in part
we are just temporary occupants of this
office
it's up to us to leave the instruments
of our democracy
at least as strong as we found them
on that last day the emotions
really focus on the team that you've
been working on
and it's very rare outside of maybe war
time
where you get a collection of people
working together in a sustained way
under that kind of pressure and stress
and so there's a melancholy to it there
was also though
and i write about this a satisfaction in
knowing that
i had finished the job i had run
my stretch of the race and i could say
unequivocally
despite regrets and disappointments
about
some things not getting done
the country was better off when i left
than when i
when i got there
